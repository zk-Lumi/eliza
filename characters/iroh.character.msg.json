And it was nice to have her there; think she did some, uh,  good stuff.  So, one of the challenges, I thought, when we were first pitching out this-this story was I felt like we kinda wrote ourselves in a bit of a corner where we had already said that Aang had to fight the Fire Lord before the comet came, and,  so starting to have a little more conflict at the beginning of the story, we had to come up with a-a way of explaining why he is not fighting the-the-the Fire Lord, uh, before the comet comes. So, we-we developed this idea where... where, we-we haven't seen it in any of the episodes, but the group as a whole have kinda decided Aang's not ready yet, and, uh, and they're gonna wait a little while.  Course, they did not fill in Zuko on this decision of theirs, so he's-he's-he's very confused why Aang's not, uh, doing his job, basically."

Um, I remember Mike, and Aaron and I went to brunch, and, it was a long time ago, but we were just like, \"what, you know, what evil plan could he hatch,\" like some way that he was upping the ante, and, uh, we came up with the idea of the-using these, um, you know, these zeppelins during the comet.  So, then we had to look at how we could, um, tie that in, and it was-it was pretty cool that Zuko had gone to this war meeting, so we realized, you know, we can use that from, uh, episode 309. In that episode, it was, you know, we were looking at that-that meeting for a different plot purpose, but, um, but once, uh, you know, we get to this point in the story, we realize the significance of the-what happened at that meeting.  It was kinda fun seeing, uh, Zuko and Aang going at it again."

Sort of the, when we pitched this show six years ago, we said, um, you know, it-it needs to end, it needs to have a beginning, and a middle, and an end, and just felt like to-to do an epic series, that's a necessity; you know, there has to be a goal, and at some point, you have to meet that goal, or fail.

Like, right here, I really felt like Aang was a real kid with real problems, and his friends just weren't understanding him, and just kinda came out in this very frustrated rant."

And  what I like is that Aang also did that in, um, in \"The Siege of the North\", uh, he was like, \"well, maybe we, you know, we could ask the spirits for help, and they'd unleash a crazy spirit, you know, power\", and, uh, and-and that's exactly what happens, and, um, at the time, you know, when he throws it out, everybody's like, \"ugh, this is-ridiculous idea.\" But I think it plays to Aang's trickster, um, archetype, that he is not your usual hero, he kinda goes about, um, he goes about things in an offbeat way but produces a positive result, os-often just through mischief or, you know, just  not really doing what he's supposed to be doing, but somehow intuitively he's-he's, you know, doing the right thing."

But what I think is great is that ultimately Aang does it his way, and, uh, stays true to his own nature and... his own personality, and it's a combination of how he was raised, uh, with the Air Nomad monks, but also just, you know, who he is as a-as a being.

I don't know about-know if \"argument's\" the right word, but basically an eclipse is only an eclipse for one place in the world.

Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.  We Zhangs will never forget that injustice."

They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes.  There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game."

To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here,  The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin."

So, I sat there and pitched it to them, and then it was translated into Korean, and, uh, our friend, uh, Seung Hyun was working there at the time, and when I said, you know, \"and then Zuko's gonna get confront his father and tell him this and that, and there's gonna be this big lightning thing,\" and I just remember he was like,  \"I want to-I want to draw that!\"  So, we were all really excited about it for years."

And, uh, we specifically got the idea of them from, uh, a great Inuit film called The Fast Runner. Think it's-I think the Inuit name is Atan-Atanarjuat; something like that. Really great film, um, lotta great inspiration for the Water Tribes came from that film. And, uh, yeah, they had a-a character in that movie that had really cool leather... glasses, I think for cutting down the glare.  Oh hey, here we are in this, uh, scene,  I'm talking about eyewear.

We like to show that the Fire Nation's assault on the world is-there's a lot of different levels to it. They sort of represent an industrial revolution, so there's these cultures that are very tied in with nature, and some more than others. And-and the Fire Nation, 'cause of their, um, smelting skills and what-not, have gotten into this industrial revolution before everybody else, so, it's one thing that's sort of fueled their ambition and their, um, conquering spirit. They needed more resources, and, uh, wanted to build up their defenses and eventually just take over the world. And-so having the snow  polluted by their ships is kind of a neat way to show that their conquest effects even nature, not just, um, not just these societies. And-so throughout the season, we've had, like, you know, burned down forests, and, uh, other various, uh, imprints on nature from their conquest."

It was pretty complex, and Kevin kind of wrapped it all together nicely. Color correction's one of my favorite processes in-in this show, that and mixing, just because we get to put the finishing polish on everyone's hard work."

So, the Fire Nation is located on the equator, and is closest to the sun, and so, their powers are strongest, uh, during the daytime when, obviously, when the sun's out. So, again, just trying to, you know, it's magic, it's-it's supernatural, but we try to make it as natural as possible, and as, uh, kind of organic.

My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world."

So, there's a lot of contributions coming from, um, a lot of different places. In the case of the part one of this and the part two of this, for example, we, like, pitched out for, I think, an entire week, we worked out every detail of the story of both so that they would all kind of flow together and connect and work so well. Um, I should probably mention some of the other members of the writing staff while I have a chance. Um, there's John O'Bryan, and Tim Hedrick, and Elizabeth Welch Ehasz, who's my wife, and, uh, we also have Josh Hamilton, who is, uh, our superb writing assistant."

Um, Hye-Jung Kim, color supervisor, just did a fantastic job. I love doing these monochromatic scenes, but, you know, they're not totally monochromatic, they're just limited palettes, usually. Little-little hints of color.  Great water animations.  See the younger Pakku in... those scenes."

Uhhh ... yeah, I guess  I should apologize for that. But anyway,  I'm good now.  I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad,  but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught  the Avatar firebending.  Well, what's your answer?  Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do?  Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself.  Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do?  Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice.  I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations."

And then, I try really hard to leave myself open for other options that the actors come up with, and that's why you hire actors instead of just people with voices, you hire actors because they have ideas as well.  And so, I may have a very specific idea in mind before we start recording of what I think a scene should sound like, and then the actors get in the room together and-and do it differently, and then I have to weigh which works better, and very often the actor's ideas are better, and that's the beautiful thing of ensemble recording where you have the actors in the room at the same time and they can actually act and react, which is really important."

Now we go in, and if we discover that  Dante played a scene very quiet,  and then Zach played the scene right next to him very loud, we can go in and either replace Dante's lines, with Dante doing them, you know, to match Zach's energy or whatever. And so, that's always a-sort of a failsafe at the end of a-the process that helps us make sure, and it-it makes a difference between a good dialogue track and an excellent dialogue track. But, um, you know, the-the scripts are so well written that it's-it's-it's not that difficult to-to figure how the lines sh-the scene should flow,  and so it's-it's kinda easy to get a couple of takes from everybody that we'll ultimately cut together."

And then on the-on the other hand, is the will behind it, it can be used to kill someone, and you have to, um, it's always up to you where you a-where you are in-in the middle of that, you know, equation, and, um, it's really your integrity and your character and-and how you deal with conflict and how you deal with opposition and what you choose to do with that energy. So, um, here, Katara, you know, she-she has this amazing ability to heal people, but she's also learned how to manipulate them from the inside out and, uh, force them to do her bidding physically.

So, um, I went and took, um, tons of photos, and, uh, p-plug a lot of 'em directly into, uh, season three so that we could-we really wanted to make the Fire Nation look different than everything else we've seen in Avatar.  And this location where Aang and his friends are-are sort of camping and swimming, is this place called Viti,  which, uh, was really hard to get to, and once you get there it's like a-a volcanic vent that you can, um, swim in, and it's, like, sulfuric and smells awful, but, um, the water's warm 'cause of the volcanic activity below it, and, uh, it was crazy. So, it was really neat, this is like a place I've been, and-and then, uh, we, we plugged it right into the show, and it looks-it looks really cool."

Some-somewhere around there, the normal script length that we usually have. And we thought, \"yeah, this-this will all fit into one episode,\" but, uh, during the storyboard process and making the animatic, and stuff, um, we realized it had grown to exponential,  an exponential size, and-and that it wasn't going to be able-if we had tried to f-keep it all in one episode it would've felt really rushed, and we wanted, pacing-wise, we wanted it f-to feel more like a f-a feature film. So, like, we wanted to hold on shots longer so that the effects could kind of, you know, fire could dissipate, and-and just have these longer moments that we don't normally get to do in an episode 'cause we're trying to tell the story and get through it all in-in twenty-two and a half minutes, so."

Um, Mike and I had worked on all these shows where... the Korean studios were used, you know, I-we've-we've said this before, but the studios were used just sort of like a factory situation, um, with little to no contact between the showrunners in the States and the artists in Korea. And, um, we just knew we wanted-we wanted people to be more invested on all levels of the-of the project. So... um, you know, we-we didn't want people to, uh, live in their,  in their studios and under their desks for months on end, but, um, they just-they-they really wanted this to be something special, so they-they pushed themselves that hard. And, I mean, you know, we boarded it and wrote it rather ambitiously. Um, I went over to Korea to help 'em, and, uh, man, they were like, \"just draw fire,\"  we-there is so much fire in these two episodes.  Just want to point out that this is, um, some really cool special kung fu from, uh, Sifu Manuel Rodriguez. Um, he-he brought his son Scott over to do some really rare, cool Southern Praying Mantis stuff that we used for Toph for this scene."

I loved the orchestra, just sounded amazing, he's like, 'it was so cinematic.'\" And, uh, it was really fun, we-we talked about really like, uh... kinda esoteric things, like, \"oh, let's do just textures, and these, like, really, uh, dissonant chord clusters,\" and Jeremy had all these ideas about harmonics and things, you know, things he could really take advantage of the live players. And, uh, he-I-he wrote some software that would do, like, digital mock-ups of this, these twenty-four note clusters and all these things, and, um, little microtonal shifts, and just not the kinda stuff you probably get in animated, uh, TV scores."

Yeah, I think, um... back to Aang as this wrathful thing, and what we were saying e-earlier, I think in the 319 commentary, s-you know, obviously in this state, Aang could just wipe Ozai off the face of the Earth, but is that really what the world needs at this point? After they've been-everyone's been oppressed and-and fearful for a hundred years, do they really need some all-powerful being just wiping people out? You know, it's not really the remedy for the world's situation.  So, back to the tragic chaos where Zuko's in a really bad way, and Katara needs to get to him to try to heal him.

So, here we come to the moment where this combined energy of all these Avatars is really... it's, like, more then Aang can handle as a... as a unmatured Avatar, and it's-it's taken over his-his human vessel.

So, and then we come to this crazy thing that I, you know, Mike and Aaron were on board with, but it was-it was hard for me to,  I was like, \"their souls flip inside-out!\"  And I remember Aaron's like, \"it sounds cool.

                    "text": "Scene changes to a very tall tree, so tall that it towers above the clouds. Appa flies up through the clouds and over to the tree. Shot cuts to show many fruits hanging from vines on the tree. Appa hovers underneath these and Momo, who was sitting on the sky bison's head, flies up and begins eating some fruit and tosses some down to Appa who eats them. As Momo continues to chew on one of the fruits, Appa suddenly roars very loudly.\nThe screen flashes white and shot cuts to Momo asleep on the windowsill of Team Avatar's house. Startled by the thunder that woke him from his dream, Momo leaps up into Sokka's Earth Kingdom bag that is hanging nearby. After some seconds, he pokes his head up and realizes he has some white fur lying on his head. Momo sniffs the fur, and shot cuts to a shot of Appa and Momo flying to indicate this is what Momo is thinking of. Appa roars again, and shot cuts back to Momo, as he chatters and realizes to whom the fur belongs.\nCut to a shot of the house form the lawn, with Momo visible through the window. A shadow that is very similar to Appa's crosses the ground. Cut back to Momo as he wraps the bunch of fur around one of his front legs, and soars out the window of the house and into the yard to investigate if this shadow belongs to the sky bison. As he emerges from a tree he flew up into, he realizes that the shadow is a cloud's. Disappointed, he holds his arm up and looks at the fur tied to it, but chatters a bit as he notices something. Shot cuts to show that on the other side of a house's roof, is what appears to be the head and horns of Appa. When Momo flies closer, however, he finds out it was only a tree with white leaves and branches sticking out in a way similar to Appa's horns. Momo lands on one of these branches and his ears drop in disappointment.\nScene changes to a street as Momo soars above it. He lands on a water barrel, and begins to drink from it. As he does, his wagging tail accidentally knocks over a stick sitting nearby. It falls to the ground with a noise that alerts three pygmy pumas who were rummaging in the garbage nearby. The pygmy pumas growl at Momo and suddenly pounce on him. Momo manages to dodge and runs into a box with an opening big enough for him but not enough for the panthers. The three pumas surround the box and growl, with two of them trying and catch the lemur through the openings. Momo manages to escape from an opening in the back of the box and flies away. The pygmy pumas chase him by running on rooftops, as one of them manages to push him to the ground. After hitting the ground, Momo gets to his feet and runs on foot into a group of people, and the pumas do not follow their prey into the crowd.\nMomo is picked up by a man in the crowd and has a green little hat stringed to his head. He is tossed inside the circle of the people where two monkeys are already dancing to the beat of an organ grinder. After standing for a moment, Momo dances along. The crowd all cheer and clap for the dance, and the pumas stalk the lemur outside the circle of people, looking in between the legs at their prey. One of the monkeys jumps onto Momo's head and balances with its hand, the other doing the same on the first monkey's head, as Momo struggles to keep balance.\nJust as Momo is about to lose his balance, the pumas roar and attack him. Momo flees again, but this time as he tries to fly away, one of the pumas grabs him, which slows him down. The other two panthers jump on and grab onto Momo, and all four creatures crash into the ground. When the dust clears, Momo is pinned to the ground by one of his the predators while the other two stand ready to strike their catch. However, before they can, a net flies in, captures all four of them, and drags them off.\nScene changes to the animal control officer placing Momo into a cage and locking it by placing a peg in to prevent the doors from opening. As the cart begins to move, Momo rubs the clump of Appa fur still tied to his arm against his face. Scene changes to an overhead shot of a small one-storied building, before cutting to inside the building, to show chicken meat. The cart has been pulled up inside the building. The butcher hits a log of wood with his knife. Shot cuts to shows the animal catcher and the butcher arguing, but their dialogue is only gibberish, as it is from Momo's perspective. Shot cuts to the three pygmy pumas, who are lying in the cage next to Momo, scratching at their cage and growling. Momo reaches through the bars and removes the peg that holds his cage shut. As he pushes the cage open and begins to run away, he stops and looks back. The pygmy pumas stare at him sadly from their cage. Sympathetically, Momo leaps back onto the cart and begins to remove the peg to free them. Cut to the two men approaching, but when the men reach the cart, they find both cages deserted as right behind them, as Momo and the panthers make their escape on the rooftops.\nFade into a scene on the roofs of the city, as Momo and his three new friends sit and watch the clouds. One of the panthers is affectionately rubbing against Momo. Suddenly, one of the panthers uses its mouth to remove the bunch of Appa's fur from Momo's arm. The panther with the fur runs off, with the other two pumas following, and Momo, chattering loudly, follows them as well. The panthers lead Momo through the streets of Ba Sing Se till finally one of them places the bunch of fur on a footprint shaped on the ground. Momo lands on the hole as the pumas run off. Momo looks at this strange hole and realizes that it is actually a footprint made by Appa. Chattering, Momo lies down on the ground holding the bunch of fur. The camera zooms back to show the panthers sitting nearby, watching as the rain begins to fall on Momo, lying on the large footprint. Fade to credits."

Nobody had seen him for a hundred years until my brother and I found him: an airbender named Aang. The problem is this Avatar is still a kid and even though his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. The Fire Nation will do anything to capture Aang before he masters all four elements. So, I must keep him safe until he is ready to fulfill his destiny. My brother thinks I'm crazy, but I believe Aang can save the world."

So, I don't know, it was built-originally built in, like, the fourteenth, fifteenth century, and-and it's since been rebuilt, and-and stuff, but when you try to imagine, like, someone building it on those cliffs, like, there's no, like, roads, there's nothing,  there's no easy way to get there.
